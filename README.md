# Vehicle-Highway-Speed-Tracking-System
Detects vehicle speeding on a highway using OpenCV written in Python.

In this project, I aim to calculate the speed of cars on the road and display them as the output. The system will display the last known speed of the vehicle in an area along with the maximum speed limit of the area. The point of this system is to help the user gauge the speed of vehicles for multiple purposes such as ensuring the safety of the area, vehicle passing by and many more
